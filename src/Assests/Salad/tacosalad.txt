1. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Rub steak with taco seasoning and sear until desired doneness, flipping once. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes, then slice against the grain.
2. Meanwhile, make dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together remaining oil, lime juice, cumin, and oregano, and season with salt.
3. In a salad bowl, add romaine, seared steak, corn, black beans, tomatoes, and green onions. Season with flaky salt, if desired.
