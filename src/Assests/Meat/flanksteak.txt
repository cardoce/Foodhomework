1. In a large bowl, whisk together olive oil, soy sauce, lime juice and brown sugar. Add steak and toss until coated. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.
2. Remove steak from marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Season lightly with salt (remembering there was soy sauce in the marinade) and pepper.
3. To grill: Preheat grill to medium-high. Place on grill and cook steak to your liking, about 6 minutes per side for medium-rare. (Cooking time will vary due to thickness of your steak.)
4. To broil: Preheat oven broiler to high. Place steak on a sheet pan and cook, turning once halfway, until cooked to your liking, about 6 minutes per side for medium-rare. (Cooking time will vary due to thickness of your steak.)
