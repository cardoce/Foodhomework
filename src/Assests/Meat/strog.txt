1. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Season steak with salt and pepper and add to the skillet in a single layer. Brown on all sides and cook until medium-rare, 2 to 4 minutes (less if you’re using strips of steaks).
2. Remove steak to rest on a plate, then add butter to the same skillet. When butter has melted, add onions and mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper and sauté until onions are soft and mushrooms are tender. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add white wine, Worcestershire, and beef stock. Bring to a simmer.
3. Whisk together cornstarch and water to make a slurry, then pour into the simmering mixture in the skillet. Reduce heat and add mustard and sour cream. Stir until evenly incorporated, then add steak back to the skillet and toss to coat the meat.
4. Serve over buttered egg noodles and garnish with chopped parsley.
