1. Make the aioli: With a mortar and pestle, mash garlic with salt until a paste forms. Transfer paste to a small bowl and whisk in olive oil, mayonnaise, and lemon zest, then season with pepper.
2. Make the steak: Brush steak with oil and season with salt and pepper. In a cast-iron pan over medium-high heat, sear both sides. Cook 3 minutes per side to the desired temperature and remove from heat. Let steak rest 15 minutes before slicing. Slice against the grain in 2-inch sections.
3. Assemble the sandwich: Lightly butter rolls and toast in a Krups toaster oven until golden. Place skirt steak on the bottom half of each roll and place 2 slices of provolone on top.
4. Put back in toaster oven to melt cheese. Remove from oven and top with arugula and peppers. Generously spread the aioli on top half of rolls before topping the finished sandwiches.
