1. Preheat oven to 400°. Line a large baking sheet with foil and lay the potatoes on top. Pierce all over with a fork, then rub the potatoes all over with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Bake until the skin is crispy and the potato is tender, about 1 hour. Let cool slightly until cool enough to handle.
2. Meanwhile, make filling: Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and peppers, and season with salt and pepper. Sauté until onions are translucent and peppers are tender, 7 to 10 minutes.
3. Push the vegetables to one side of the pan and add meat to the other side. Season with oregano, salt and pepper. Let them sit for a minute or so to sear, then sauté on the same side of pan until mostly cooked through, about another 5 minutes. Toss everything together in pan to evenly distribute meat and vegetables. Remove from heat and set aside.
4. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them in half lengthwise. Scoop out the flesh with a spoon, leaving a ¼ thick inch by the skin. Return the potatoes, cut side-up, to the baking sheet. Fill with steak and pepper filling and top each with a handful of shredded provolone. Bake until cheese is melty, 3-4 minutes. 
5. Garnish with parsley and serve.
