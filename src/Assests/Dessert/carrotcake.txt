1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Make cake: In a large bowl, beat sugar, oil, and eggs with an electric mixer until blended, about 30 seconds. Add flour, cinnamon, baking soda, vanilla and salt, beating for about 1 minute or until incorporated. Fold in carrots, nuts and raisins. Pour into well-greased and floured 8-inch round baking pans. Bake 33 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with just a few crumbs. Remove from oven and let cool 10 minutes before removing from pans. Let cool completely.
3. Make frosting: In a large bowl, combine cream cheese and butter, beating them until fluffy, about 1 minute. Slowly add the powdered sugar, then vanilla and lemon juice. Beat on low until soft and fluffy. Spread onto cooled cake.
