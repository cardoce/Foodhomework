1. Preheat oven to 350° and line a 8”-x-8” square pan with parchment paper. In a blender or food processor, combine all ingredients (4 large eggs, 2 ripe avocados, 1/2 c. (1 stick) butter, melted, 6 tbsp. unsweetened peanut butter, 2 tsp. baking soda, 2/3 c. coconut sugar, 2/3 c. Unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 tsp. pure vanilla extract, 1 tsp. kosher salt) and blend until smooth. 
2. Transfer batter to prepared baking pan and smooth top with a spatula. Top with flaky sea salt, if using.
3. Bake until brownies are soft but not at all wet to the touch, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool 25 to 30 minutes before slicing and serving.
