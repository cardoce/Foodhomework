1. Finely chop onion and garlic and grate ginger root. Chop chicken into 1 inch cubes.
2. Add coconut oil to medium-high heat skillet or pot. (You will be simmering this for 30-60 minutes so you want a pot that can hold a good amount of liquid.)
3. Add chicken and cook partially.
4. Add onion, ginger, garlic, curry powder, and cinnamon to the pan with the chicken and cook for 2-3 minutes, careful not to burn the spices.
5. Add coconut milk and broth and stir. Reduce for 40-60 minutes until desired consistency is achieved. The sauce should be thick as shown in the pictures. If your sauce is not thick enough, let it cook longer to reduce.
