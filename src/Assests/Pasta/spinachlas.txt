3. In a large bowl, stir together ricotta, egg, and Parmesan and season with cinnamon, salt, and pepper.
4. In a large baking dish, layer 5 lasagna noodles so they’re slightly overlapping. Spoon over a thin layer of marinara and top with a layer of spinach mixture and ricotta mixture. Sprinkle with a layer of mozzarella. Repeat, ending with mozzarella.
5. Cover with foil and bake 45 minutes, then remove foil and continue baking 15 minutes more.
